# Personal-Website

In this project, I am working on creating a functional website that implements a 'Home' page, an 'About' page, and a 'Portfolio' page as a tool to not
only highlight key information about myself, but to give my "employer" a good idea of the level of skill I have with the fullstack development.

The goal is to practice writing semantic HTML, basic CSS, and Javascript.

All of the following criteria:

1. GitHub repository, with:
More than one branch (including main/master), with descriptive branch name(s)
More than one commit, with descriptive commit messages
A descriptive Readme file

2. A functional website that fulfills the requirements, and includes:
three pages: home, about, work/portfolio
A persistent header with links
Personalized content, including both formatted text and images
Basic CSS styling, included via an external file

3. A "Hello world" tier Javascript function, loaded via an external file
e.g., a console.log of a given string

4. HTML/CSS/JavaScript files submitted via a GitHub repository
